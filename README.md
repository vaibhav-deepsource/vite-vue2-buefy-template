# Vite âš¡ - Vue 2 (without composition API) starter template

> Note: A starter template for Vue 2 already exist [here](https://github.com/lstoeferle/vite-vue2-windicss-starter). However, it uses composition API so I made one with Options API instead, for legacy reasons. Also a more minimal version of it & a bit opinionated.

This starter template will help you to easily create a Vue2 application (with Options API) bundled by the lightning fast build tool called [Vite](https://github.com/vitejs/vite). Besides Vite this template also provides:

- Vue Router
- WindiCSS (TailwindCSS) + Dark Mode
